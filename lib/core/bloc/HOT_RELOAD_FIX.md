# Fix for "Could not find summary for library flutter_bloc" Error

## Problem Description

The error "Bad state: Could not find summary for library 'package:flutter_bloc/src/bloc_builder.dart'" appears in the debug console during hot restart or hot reload, but the app continues to work normally.

## Root Cause

This is a known issue with Flutter's hot reload mechanism when using BLoC, particularly with:

- Nested BlocBuilders
- Multiple BlocProviders
- Complex BLoC state management during development

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Optimized BlocBuilder Usage

**File**: `lib/main.dart`

Added `buildWhen` conditions to prevent unnecessary rebuilds:

```dart
return BlocBuilder<ThemeBloc, ThemeState>(
  buildWhen: (previous, current) => previous.themeMode != current.themeMode,
  builder: (context, themeState) {
    return BlocBuilder<FontSizeBloc, FontSizeState>(
      buildWhen: (previous, current) => previous.fontSize != current.fontSize,
      builder: (context, fontState) {
        // ... rest of the code
      },
    );
  },
);
```

### 2. Added BlocObserver for Debugging

**File**: `lib/core/bloc/app_bloc_observer.dart`

Created a custom BlocObserver to help debug BLoC lifecycle issues:

```dart
class AppBlocObserver extends BlocObserver {
  @override
  void onCreate(BlocBase bloc) {
    super.onCreate(bloc);
    if (kDebugMode) {
      print('✅ BLoC Created: ${bloc.runtimeType}');
    }
  }

  // ... other override methods for debugging
}
```

And enabled it in main.dart:

```dart
Future<void> main() async {
  WidgetsFlutterBinding.ensureInitialized();

  // Set BLoC observer for debugging hot reload issues
  if (kDebugMode) {
    Bloc.observer = AppBlocObserver();
  }

  // ... rest of main function
}
```

### 3. Optimized BlocListener Usage

**File**: `lib/features/houses/presentation/screens/house_form_screen.dart`

Added `listenWhen` conditions to reduce unnecessary listener calls:

```dart
return BlocListener<HousesBloc, HousesState>(
  listenWhen: (previous, current) {
    // Only listen to error states and when transitioning to loaded
    return current is HousesError ||
           (previous is! HousesLoaded && current is HousesLoaded);
  },
  listener: (context, state) {
    if (state is HousesError) {
      FlutterToastX.error(state.message);
    }
    // Reset submitting state for both error and success
    if (mounted) {
      _model!.isSubmitting.value = false;
    }
  },
  child: HouseFormScaffold(/* ... */),
);
```

### 4. Modern Dart Syntax

Replaced switch statements with pattern matching for better hot reload compatibility:

```dart
// Before
ThemeMode flutterThemeMode;
switch (themeState.themeMode) {
  case AppThemeMode.light:
    flutterThemeMode = ThemeMode.light;
    break;
  // ... other cases
}

// After
final ThemeMode flutterThemeMode = switch (themeState.themeMode) {
  AppThemeMode.light => ThemeMode.light,
  AppThemeMode.dark => ThemeMode.dark,
  AppThemeMode.system => ThemeMode.system,
};
```

## Additional Troubleshooting Steps

### Step 1: Clean Build

When encountering this error, run:

```bash
flutter clean
flutter pub get
```

### Step 2: Check Dependencies

Ensure compatibility between flutter_bloc and hydrated_bloc versions:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter_bloc: ^9.1.1
  hydrated_bloc: ^10.1.1
```

### Step 3: Restart IDE

Sometimes the error persists in the IDE cache. Restart VS Code or Android Studio.

### Step 4: Check for Memory Leaks

Ensure proper disposal of BloC resources:

- Use `listenWhen` and `buildWhen` appropriately
- Dispose of controllers and notifiers properly
- Avoid creating BLoCs in build methods

## Why This Error Occurs

1. **Hot Reload Limitations**: Flutter's hot reload has limitations with complex state management
2. **BLoC Analysis**: The analyzer sometimes loses track of BLoC dependencies during hot reload
3. **Development Only**: This error typically only occurs in development mode with hot reload

## Impact

- ❌ **Error appears**: In debug console during hot reload/restart
- ✅ **App works**: Functionality remains unaffected
- ✅ **Production safe**: Error doesn't occur in release builds
- ✅ **Performance**: No runtime performance impact

## Prevention

1. **Use buildWhen/listenWhen**: Always specify when BLoC widgets should rebuild/listen
2. **Avoid nested BlocProviders**: Use MultiBlocProvider at app root when possible
3. **Proper disposal**: Ensure all BLoC instances are properly disposed
4. **Clean dependencies**: Keep flutter_bloc and related packages up to date

## Verification

After implementing these fixes:

1. Run `flutter analyze` - should show no errors
2. Test hot reload functionality - error should be reduced or eliminated
3. Monitor debug console for BLoC lifecycle events
4. Verify app functionality remains intact

The app should now have better hot reload stability and reduced console errors while maintaining full functionality.
