# Consumption Card UI Enhancement

## Summary

Created a custom `ConsumptionCard` widget to replace the basic `ListTile` in the dashboard, providing a better visual design and more options menu.

## Changes Made

### 1. New Custom Widget: `ConsumptionCard`

**File:** `lib/presentation/mobile/features/dashboard/presentation/components/consumption_card.dart`

**Features:**

- **Modern Card Design**: Rounded corners, elevated appearance
- **Index Badge**: Circular badge showing consumption number
- **Meter Reading**: Displayed prominently in kWh
- **Date & Time**: Shown with icons for better readability
- **Units Consumed**: Highlighted in a colored badge
- **Total Cost**: Displayed in primary color for emphasis
- **More Options Menu**: PopupMenuButton with Edit and Delete options

**Design Highlights:**

- Uses theme colors for consistency
- Material Design 3 principles (surface containers, proper spacing)
- Icon-based visual hierarchy
- Responsive padding and spacing

### 2. Updated Dashboard

**File:** `lib/presentation/mobile/features/dashboard/presentation/screens/dashboard.dart`

**Changes:**

- Replaced `ListTile` with `ConsumptionCard`
- Added structured callbacks for edit and delete actions
- Delete functionality fully implemented
- Edit functionality shows "coming soon" message (placeholder for future implementation)

### 3. Cycle Recalculation Feature

**Previously Implemented:**

- When cycle's `pricePerUnit` or `initialMeterReading` is updated, all associated consumption readings are automatically recalculated
- Ensures data integrity across the application

## UI Design

### Before (ListTile):

```
[1] 10500                               100 units
    01-01-2024 (10:30 AM)                ₹750.00
```

### After (ConsumptionCard):

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  [1]   10500 kWh                  [100 units]   │
│        📅 01-01-2024  🕐 10:30 AM   ₹750.00  ⋮ │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

With the ⋮ (more options) button providing:

- ✏️ Edit (coming soon)
- 🗑️ Delete

## Interaction Changes

### Before:

- Long press to delete

### After:

- Click ⋮ button → popup menu
- Select "Delete" → confirmation dialog → delete
- Select "Edit" → shows "coming soon" message

## Pending Work

### Edit Consumption Feature

To implement edit functionality, the following changes are needed:

1. **Update `CreateConsumptionScreen`**:

   - Add optional `readingId` parameter
   - Load existing reading data when `readingId` is provided
   - Change app bar title based on mode (Create vs Edit)
   - Call `updateReading` instead of `createReading` when in edit mode

2. **Add Route**:

   - Route name: `edit-consumption`
   - Path: `/edit-consumption/:readingId`
   - Builder: `CreateConsumptionScreen(readingId: readingId)`

3. **Update Dashboard**:
   - Replace placeholder with: `context.pushNamed('edit-consumption', pathParameters: {'readingId': reading.id})`

**Note:** The edit feature pattern is identical to how cycle editing was implemented. Reference `create_cycle_screen.dart` for the implementation pattern.

## Benefits

1. **Better UX**: More intuitive interaction with popup menu
2. **Visual Hierarchy**: Important information stands out
3. **Consistency**: Matches modern Material Design patterns
4. **Accessibility**: Proper semantic structure, clear touch targets
5. **Extensibility**: Easy to add more options to the menu

## Files Changed

- ✅ `lib/presentation/mobile/features/dashboard/presentation/components/consumption_card.dart` (new)
- ✅ `lib/presentation/mobile/features/dashboard/presentation/screens/dashboard.dart` (updated)
- ✅ `lib/presentation/mobile/features/dashboard/presentation/components/cycle_summary_card.dart` (fixed import)

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Visual Testing**:

   - Verify card appearance on different screen sizes
   - Check theme colors in light/dark mode
   - Ensure proper spacing and alignment

2. **Interaction Testing**:

   - Tap more options button → menu appears
   - Select delete → confirmation → reading deleted
   - Select edit → shows coming soon message
   - Verify menu dismisses on outside tap

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - Single consumption in list
   - Many consumptions (scrolling)
   - Very long meter reading numbers
   - Very large/small cost values

## Future Enhancements

- Swipe to delete gesture
- Pull to refresh
- Consumption trend indicators (↑ ↓)
- Comparison with previous reading
- Daily average calculation display
- Export/share functionality in more options menu
