# üöÄ Quick Fix for "No Public Table Found" Error

## Problem

You're getting "no public table found" error because the Supabase database tables haven't been created yet.

## ‚úÖ Solution (Follow these steps)

### Step 1: Verify .env file exists

‚úÖ **DONE** - Your `.env` file is already configured with Supabase credentials

### Step 2: Create Database Tables in Supabase

‚ö†Ô∏è **YOU MUST DO THIS NOW** - The tables don't exist yet!

1. Open your browser and go to: https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/qllihzwtdnvkecswzypi/sql/new

2. Open the file `SUPABASE_SQL_SETUP.sql` in this project

3. Copy ALL the SQL code from that file

4. Paste it into the Supabase SQL Editor

5. Click **"RUN"** button

6. You should see "Success. No rows returned" - this means it worked!

### Step 3: Test the backup feature

1. Run your Flutter app
2. Go to Settings
3. Sign in with email/password (or create account)
4. Try the backup feature again

## What the SQL does

- Creates 4 tables: `houses`, `cycles`, `electricity_readings`, `backup_metadata`
- Sets up Row Level Security (RLS) so users can only access their own data
- Creates indexes for better performance
- Links all data to user accounts for security

## Verification

After running the SQL, you can verify tables were created:

1. Go to: https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/qllihzwtdnvkecswzypi/editor
2. You should see 4 new tables in the left sidebar

## Still Having Issues?

- Make sure you're signed in to the app before trying to backup
- Check the Supabase dashboard to confirm tables exist
- Check that RLS policies are enabled (should happen automatically with the SQL)
