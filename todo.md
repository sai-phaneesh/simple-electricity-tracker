# üè† Electricity Tracker - Comprehensive Roadmap & TODO

## üîî Requested Feature Additions (Auth, Sync, Ads, Payments, Notifications)

The following items were requested to be added to the roadmap ‚Äî each is broken down into actionable subtasks, migration notes and priority.

1. Google Auth login using Firebase

- Add `lib/core/auth/auth_repository.dart` (abstract) and `lib/core/auth/firebase_auth_repository.dart` (implementation).
- Wire Google Sign-In using `firebase_auth` + `google_sign_in` and platform setup (Android, iOS, Web, macOS, Windows).
- Add `AuthBloc` or extend app-level bloc to expose auth state to the UI.
- Priority: High.

2. Use Firebase for cloud backup & sync when online

- Add `lib/core/services/remote_sync/remote_sync_repository.dart` (abstract) and `lib/core/services/remote_sync/firebase_remote_sync.dart`.
- Implement push/pull, lastUpdated timestamps and conflict resolution strategy.
- Keep local Drift DB as source-of-truth with eventual consistency and local-first UX.
- Priority: High.

3. Login and logout handling

- Ensure robust session handling in `AuthBloc`: login, logout, token refresh, auth state stream.
- On login: offer merge/replace choice for existing local data and start sync subscriptions.
- On logout: stop sync and optionally clear sensitive cached data (based on user preference).
- Priority: High.

4. Migration-friendly architecture (future-proof)

- All remote code behind `remote_sync_repository` + DI so swapping backend later requires only an implementation change.
- Keep serialization/mapping logic isolated (mappers) and small public DTOs.
- Priority: High.

5. Local notifications and Firebase push notifications

- Implement `lib/core/notifications/local_notifications_service.dart` using `flutter_local_notifications`.
- Implement `lib/core/notifications/firebase_messaging_service.dart` using `firebase_messaging` for cloud push.
- Support routing notifications into the app and triggering sync if needed.
- Priority: Medium.

6. Multiple device login

- Track device instances per user in Firestore (device id, lastSeen, name).
- Provide UI to view/revoke devices; enforce device limits per plan via security rules or Cloud Functions.
- Priority: Medium.

7. Google Ads cross-platform

- Integrate `google_mobile_ads` for Android/iOS.
- Provide platform-specific fallbacks or placeholders for platforms where AdMob is not supported (desktop, web).
- Wrap ad logic behind `AdsService` interface and DI so it's pluggable.
- Priority: Medium.

8. Payments for premium users

- Add `payments_repository.dart` abstract and platform-specific implementations using `in_app_purchase` for mobile and Stripe/Pay for web/desktop where needed.
- Premium: no ads, unlimited backups/restores, up to 2 devices.
- Priority: Medium.

9. Diamond users (real-time sync)

- Diamond users: every change immediately syncs to remote (low-latency mode). Use Firestore realtime listeners or Realtime DB for best latency.
- Allow unlimited devices; implement server-side enforcement and realtime merge semantics.
- Priority: Low-to-Medium.
