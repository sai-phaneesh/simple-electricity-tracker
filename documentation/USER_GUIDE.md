## Tips & Best Practices

### Recording Readings

- **Regular intervals**: Record readings at consistent times (e.g., daily, weekly)
- **Accuracy**: Double-check meter readings before submitting
- **Notes**: Use the notes field for context (e.g., "After vacation", "AC installed")

### Organizing Cycles

- **Naming**: Use clear, date-based names (e.g., "Jan-2025", "2025-Q1")
- **Duration**: Align cycles with actual billing periods
- **Pricing**: Update price per unit if rates change mid-cycle

### Managing Multiple Houses

- **Descriptive names**: Use names that clearly identify properties
- **Regular switching**: Review all properties periodically
- **Separate cycles**: Each house has independent cycles
